# Movie-Search_Engine

1st Group Project

Summary:

The project consists of a web-page designed to work as a movie search engine, this way people will be able to consult a movies rating,
release date, the movie´s plot, and external articles related to that specific film. Users will be presented with a list of most popular movies right when they access the site. Also an input is available for people to search a specific movie. The site is designed to be viewed in all devices, this way it has a better user experience.

To access the movie information, users must select the image and will be redirected to another HTML in which specific data about the film is presented.
